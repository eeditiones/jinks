        "para-1": "Jinks application manager is designed as a working environment for creating and publishing of digital scholarly editions. Editions created with this framework are aiming to meet the varied needs of several humanities disciplines (textual scholarship, literary studies, linguistics, history and more). Jinks builds on what is common, at the same time providing the choice and customisation possibilities to the editors and developers.",
        "para-2": "The platform follows the international standard for the encoding of textual data, TEI, and bases its visualisations on TEI Publisher. As a result, it enables publication of different types of material: from the basic presentation of texts and documents in digital form to the most complex scholarly editions. There is room for various forms of textual delivery (transcriptions, translations, facsimiles) and annotations.",
        "para-3": "Tools and working environment are not enough. To best serve the needs of editors, a consistent and efficient process for creating and publishing digital scholarly editions is needed. This project is offering such a process. It includes sets of good practices and workflows and takes into account both how scholarly editors work and how IT specialists, responsible for the technical side of editions, complete their tasks."
