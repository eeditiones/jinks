The IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) viewer integration allows you to display high-resolution images with zooming and panning capabilities directly in your pages. This is particularly useful for displaying manuscripts, maps, artwork, or other detailed visual materials.

## Configuration

The IIIF feature can be configured under the `features.iiif` section in the `config.json` of you app or in the frontmatter section of an HTML template:

```json
"features": {
    "iiif": {
        "viewer": "pb-tify",
        "base_uri": "https://apps.existsolutions.com/cantaloupe/iiif/2/",
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

For example, the `facsimile.html` template uses frontmatter only to configure the IIIF viewer, disable the table of contents and set an initial size for the facsimile sidebar. This template is used to display Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in the main TEI Publisher demo app:

```html
<template>
    ---json
    {
        "templating": {
            "extends": "templates/pages/basic.html"
        },
        "features": {
            "toc": {
                "enabled": false
            },
            "iiif": {
                "viewer": "pb-tify",
                "enabled": true
            }
        },
        "theme": {
            "layout": {
                "after-width": "33vw"
            }
        }
    }
    ---
</template>
```

### Available Options

- `enabled`: Set to `true` to activate the IIIF viewer on the page
- `viewer`: Specifies which IIIF viewer to use, currently `pb-tify` or `pb-facsimile`
- `base_uri`: Specifies the base URI for the IIIF image API. This is only relevant for the `pb-facsimile` viewer. `pb-tify` will get this information from the manifest.

### Viewers

* `pb-facsimile`: A viewer implementing the IIIF image API for viewing one or more images. The names/paths of those images need to be known beforehand and should be registered with the component via pb-facs-link or custom javascript. The viewer is based on [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/).
* `pb-tify`: Supports IIIF presentation manifests: instead of registering a list of images, it expects all relevant metadata - including the list of images - to be provided in a single, standardized manifest. Under the hood, pb-tify is based on [tify](https://tify.rocks/), which also uses OpenSeadragon for the image display functionality. Available since version 2.10.0 of tei-publisher-components.

Both components are usually used in conjunction with the `pb-facs-link` component (output via ODD) to register the image or manifest URLs to be displayed.

## Layout Considerations

When using the IIIF viewer, you may want to adjust the layout to accommodate the viewer interface. In the facsimile template example, the `after-width` is set to provide adequate space:

```json
"theme": {
    "layout": {
        "after-width": "33vw"
    }
}
```

This allocates 33% of the viewport width to the sidebar area, leaving more space for the main content area where the IIIF viewer will be displayed.
