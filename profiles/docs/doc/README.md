# The `docs` Blueprint

The `docs` blueprint comes closest to the old TEI Publisher in that it contains:

* the **documentation** for TEI Publisher
* **feature showcases**: a set of examples covering various aspects and showcases for features provided by other profiles

However, the blueprint lacks some components found in the old TEI Publisher, in particular, a way to upload documents or play around with ODDs. This functionality has been moved into the `playground` blueprint, which provides a sandbox environment for experimentation and learning.
