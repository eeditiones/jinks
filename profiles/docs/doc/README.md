# The `docs` Blueprint

The `docs` blueprint comes closest to the old TEI Publisher in that it contains:

* the **documentation** for TEI Publisher
* **feature showcases**: a set of example pages covering various aspects and showcases for features provided by other profiles

However, the blueprint does **not** ship with the web-based annotation editor, which can be found in the *workbench* blueprint. It also doesn't include features specific to register data or correspondence. Check the *serafin* blueprint for a demo of those.
