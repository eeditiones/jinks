# Feature for metadata section in the sidebar

This feature adds a basic metadata display block to the `after` layout area.

It processes the metadata from the `teiHeader` section of the source document, according to the ODD rules, customized for the `mode` parameter set to `metadata-panel`.

## Requirements

Appropriate processing model rules are largely already contained in `teipublisher.odd`.

## Configuration

None for the moment. Adjustments are to be made in the ODD.

## Credits

This feature has been primarily funded via [Jagiellonian Digital Platform](https://labedyt.dhlab.uj.edu.pl/)
