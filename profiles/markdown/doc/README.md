# Markdown Output Mode

This feature enables the markdown output mode for the TEI Processing Model. With this added, you may render TEI to markdown. Since markdown is not supported by default, you'll have to recompile your ODDs after enabling the feature on an already installed application. Upon re-install, the ODDs will be recompiled automatically.

Additionally, the feature adds the following:

* a markdown preview page in the browser
* an option to directly view or download the raw markdown

Corresponding entries in the download menus will become available if the document viewed also supports markdown output.
